Trying to make a Bayesian model that describe and predict the changes of users' intereset (i.e., AOI, Area of Intereset).

When riding automobiles, people often failed to properly monitor the automation system and take longer time to react to the system's take-over request. 

Furthermore, automobile sometimes issue take-over request mistakenly in two ways: issue the request even when it is actually not necessary; do not issue the request even when it is necessary.

The first mistake is called false alarm, and the second one is called miss.

In contrst to the case of human mistake, people immediately lose their trust on algorithm after seeing their err; this phenomenon is called algorithm aversion.

People also regain trust on the automation system when they keep seeing the sytem work without problems.

Research has shown that the more people trust the automation system, the lesser they monitor the system; therefore, how long they monitor the system might predict how much they trust the system.

However, previous research in the context of automation systems have just calculated the overall ratio of watching AOI, and have not made a mental model (i.e., trust on automation system) that changes as times goes.

Therefore, to make a mental model can be thought to help us understand the changes of users' trust on the automation system and also might enable us to predict how they would react to the system in the future.

Now, before running the actual psychological experiment in the laboratory, generating the dummy data and simulating whether the Bayesian modeling method could work well to make a such model.
